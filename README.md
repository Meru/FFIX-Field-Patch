## Description

This patch aims to replace horribly processed fields in FINAL FANTASY IX (PC),
which include static backgrounds, animations, lights and effects. Layer edges are
being replaced selectively. Currently there are no plans to improve text.  
  
Source for the new fields is taken from the PSX version of the game and then
processed with more sophisticated alghorithms and manual edits.  

Comparison between New and Old fields:
[Main Street]({{ 'comp1?v=' | append: site.github.build_revision | relative_url }}),
[Guardhouse]({{ 'comp2?v=' | append: site.github.build_revision | relative_url }}),
[Tree Trunk]({{ 'comp3a?v=' | append: site.github.build_revision | relative_url }}).  

You are advised to apply this patch to the unmodified PC version of the game.
